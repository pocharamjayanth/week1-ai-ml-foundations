Capstone Project: Smart Study Performance Predictor

🎯 Project Overview

This project is an end-to-end AI/ML application that predicts student academic performance. It is the final capstone for my 7-week AI \& ML course.



🚀 Key Features

Dual-Model Prediction: This system uses two models at once—Linear Regression to predict a specific Grade Point and Random Forest to predict if a student will Pass or Fail.



Integrated Pipeline: Includes data preprocessing, visualization, model training, and evaluation.



Web Deployment: A user-friendly interface built with Flask that allows real-time predictions.



🛠️ Technical Details

Parameters Used: Study Hours, Sleep Hours, Attendance, and Previous Test Scores.



Serialization: Models are saved as .pkl files using the Joblib library for fast performance.



Repository Structure: Organized into data, models, notebooks, and templates folders for professional standards.
